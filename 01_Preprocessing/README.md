# Feature engineering on imputed gene expression and environmental factors

In this module, our goal is to apply feature engineering techniques, which encompass tasks such as imputing missing values, generating new features, and encoding features from raw data.

## Scripts

```
Usage:
    
    run_making_pipline.py \
      --work_dir "/exeh_4/yuping/Epistasis_Interaction/01_Preprocessing" \
      --weight_tissue "Brain_Amygdala"
      
Output:
Feature engineering pipeline for specific imputed brain tissue and environmental factors
```



## Reproducible Analysis

To reproduce the results of the coverage analysis perform the following:

```

## Notes

#### 2023.11.15
**Finish Task**

+ Develop a feature engineering pipeline to handle gene expression and environmental factor imputation
  - Perform feature encoding and missing value imputation for the  `Income` variable.
  - Create a new feature called `Total_Education` by combining information from the `FatherEducation` and `MotherEducation` variables.
  - For more details, please refer to  `analysis.ipynb`.
